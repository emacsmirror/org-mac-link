* org-mac-link
Insert org-mode links to items selected in various Mac apps.

You can install this package by putting the file =org-mac-link.el=
into your Emacs ~load-path~.

* Attention
This package has been heavily refactored to meet some criteria of [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]] like:

- Meeting requirements of [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]]
- Meeting requirements checkdoc
- Reducing warnings when byte compiling

It is possible that your configuration might break if you customized the settings of the package a lot.
Please see the commits on the [[https://gitlab.com/aimebertrand/org-mac-link][GitLab Repo]] and in the [[file:CHANGES.org][CHANGES]] file to see the changes. Mostly changes are the names of functions and Variables, where I added the prefix of the package.
